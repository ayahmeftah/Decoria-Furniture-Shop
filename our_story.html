                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>We created Decoria’s furniture website with the goal of providing an interactive platform for users to browse and purchase furniture goods. The project involved several phases, such as planning, designing, developing, and testing. Together, we divided up the work such that each person had a clear area of responsibility to make the website interesting and easy to use.
                <br>The website consists of several pages which are the home page, living room, kitchen, Bedroom, the making of Decoria and this page, our story. In each page, you will have the best experience of getting to know new dimensions in the world of home furniture and you will find that perfect piece of furniture you were always thinking of and looking for.</p>

            <div id="ourStory_challenge">
                <h1>Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them</h1>
                <p>Effective time management and coordination were two of the many problems we encountered. We all had trouble establishing precise deadlines because of having other projects from other courses to tackle up with. Overcoming this problem was somehow easy because we only had classes to attend on Mondays and Wednesdays and the rest of the week, we were free. Therefore, we set up frequent meetings and assigned tasks to each one of us in every meeting.
                <br>Bringing together the various design ideas and opinions of our group members was another challenge we faced during the timeline of this project because the aesthetics of the website were seen differently by each member. We handled this by promoting truthful and productive discussions that let all our group members share their perspectives. We were able to reach an understanding and create an agreement such that everyone's opinions were met without sacrificing the overall quality of the design and functionality.
                <br>Another challenge we faced was making sure that our website worked and looked well across a variety of devices and screen sizes. We began by researching responsive design principles and concepts in CSS to solve this difficulty. W3schools website and multiple YouTube videos helped so much in our researching process. Also, continuous communication and cooperative efforts allowed us to effectively handle this difficulty and produce a responsive website that works flawlessly across a range of devices.
                <br>We also encountered many problems in finding errors and solving them in our code since the integrated development environment we chose to work in did not show exactly what and where the problem was. Some examples of errors were like improper element alignment and content that overlapped other content. To tackle these problems, we looked over our HTML and CSS code carefully to make sure there were no errors or incompatible styles. We examined the elements and the styles that matched them using browser developer tools like inspecting the web page, and we made the required changes to guarantee correct alignment and responsiveness.

                <h1>Lessons Learned Working in a Group</h1> 
                <p>While working on this project we gained an insightful understanding about the idea of group work. We discovered the value of each group member contributing fully and communicating with the others. We also understood how important it was to create a cooperative, encouraging atmosphere where people could openly express their thoughts and concerns transparently. We developed a great project by actively participating in conversations and utilizing the individual capabilities of each group member.
                <br>Moreover, we learned that adaptability and flexibility are one of the main and important aspects in group projects. Different people have various viewpoints and working approaches in group projects. It is crucial to accept these differences and figure out how to work well together. Working on this project showed us that it is essential to have flexibility in accepting different viewpoints and making sacrifices when necessary to have a peaceful and effective work environment.
                <br>In Addition, we were able to remain organized and fulfill deadlines by establishing reasonable objectives, dividing the work, and allocating tasks. Maintaining an eye on the development and making the required adjustments to the plans helped us to keep our project on schedule.</p>

                <h1>Lessons Learned Technically</h1>
                <p>This project gave us the opportunity to enhance our web development skills. We gained a deeper understanding of responsive design concepts which enabled us to make sure our website was usable and accessible on different devices by understanding how grids work and implemented. Another useful thing we learned while researching and implementing this project was how to create pop ups for our products and we also got to know many new selectors and properties in CSS like the focus selector.
                <br>In summary, this project was a fulfilling experience that taught us so much important knowledge on technological abilities and group project management. We handled obstacles by working together and communicating effectively, and we developed a stronger appreciation for the significance of setting specific objectives and deadlines. We now surely have a solid base for future collaborations and larger projects thanks to this project.</p>
